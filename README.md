# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [Lego Dataset](https://github.com/Landaman/dataviz-project-template-proposal). It can be found here on [VizHub](https://vizhub.com/Landaman/lego-csv). It contains information about every Lego set manufactured from 1970 to 2015, which is over 6000 sets.

A few attributes are included from each set:
- Its ID
- Its name
- Its manufacture year
- Its theme
- Its number of pieces
- Its number of minifigures
- Its price in various regions
- Its availability and box type


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

- I want to understand the correlation between cost and number of pieces
- I want to visualize how the number of pieces has changed over time
- I want to visualize how cost has changed over time
- I want to understand the correlation between theme and number of pieces
- I want to visualize which themes sets come from - perhaps a bubble chart or a pie chart could accomplish this

## Sketches

This visualization shows the percentage of lego sets that fall into each theme, relative to the others.
It also shows subcategories, representing how many sets fall into each subtheme within a given theme.

This visualization shows the interaction with this set. Hovering over a segment will show the number of sets and percentage in each theme, and clicking on a category within that popup will show the price distribution of the theme/subtheme

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a piechart and it shows the percentage of sets in each theme.

An actual prototype with the PieChart data doesn't look very good (since most of the themes have a very small number of sets)

Leaving only the top 9 and combining the rest to a "Miscellaneous" group helps a lot

This then provides the sub-themes, using "g"s to group and scaling based on the percentages calculated for each price range
